		Hello, these are some words about me.<br>

	<h1>who</h1>
	<p>
		My name is Alex Burner. I have been to<br>
		a handful of schools and held a handful<br>
		of jobs. I was working for <a href="http://groundctrl.com/">ground(ctrl)</a> but<br>
		now I attend the <a href="https://www.washington.edu/">University of Washington.</a><br>
		No matter the work or title, I still consider<br>
		myself a student. I will be done learning<br>
		when I am six feet underground.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>what</h1>
	<p>
		Most of my time is spent poking in dusty<br>
		corners and wondering how things all fit<br>
		together. I enjoy noodling around with web<br>
		design &amp; development, geometry, physics,<br>
		philosophy, and photography. I am rooted<br>
		in systems design, information architecture,<br>
		user experience, identity, and sustainability.
	</p>
	<h1>why</h1>
	<p>
<!-- 
		The world isn't perfect. That might look like a curse, but it could also be a blessing.
		If everything was perfect, what would there be left for us to do?




		the world isn't perfect. but 
		if everything was perfect, 
		if every problem was solved,
		if every hunger was filled,
		what would be left for us to do?
		better with some mess & mystery
		idle hands want for good work and 
		there will always be work ready
 -->
		The world is not perfect. But if everything was<br>
		perfect&mdash;if every problem was solved, if every<br>
		hunger was filled&mdash;what would be left for us?<br>
		Better with some mess &amp; mystery. Idle hands<br>
		itch for good work to do, and there is always<br>
		more work waiting to be done. Every time is<br>
		a chance to do better as we endlessly dance<br>
		with our golden balance of harmony.<br>
<!--



		There is always work waiting

		fisics ~ 	There is always "potential" available for "work" in a system,
					ergo there is an endless potential waiting to be realized.




		it as a curse, but it could also be a blessing. 
		If everything was perfect, what would be 
		left for us to do? More fun with a little
		mess &amp; mystery. Every day, each moment,
		is more complicated than the one before.
		And we can always do more, approaching our golden mean of harmony.
		With<br>
		perfection, what's left for us to do? More fun<br>
		to have a little mess and mystery. Every day is a little more<br>
		complicated and we can always do better,<br>
		approaching our golden mean of harmony.

	<h1>when</h1>
	<p>
		Creation is a fusion of forces, needing both<br>
		flashes of inspiration and stretches of grind.<br>
		Some great work can be done taking a shower<br>
		or getting a fresh breath outdoors. Eventually,<br>
		every idea gem needs to be cut and polished<br>
		and packaged and distributed. So the when<br>
		is a blend between dreaming and doing.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>where</h1>
	<p>
		I grew up in the suburbs of Washington.<br>
		I have lived in cities like New York, NY and<br>
		towns like Pullman, WA. Currently I am living<br>
		in Seattle, WA. I enjoy good balance between <br>
		urban and nature. I will work remotely from<br>
		anywhere, but I always respect the warmth<br>
		and power of meeting someone in person.<br>
	</p>
	<h1>how</h1>
	<p>
		Obsessiveness. Restlessness.<br>
		A stubborn refusal to grow up.<br>
		Cynicism for the big picture.<br>
		But eternal hope anyways.<br>
